A tool to help teachers generate quiz questions about their reading assignments. Try it out here: www.generationq.online

The core question generation model is a Python implementation of the paper [Learning to Ask: Neural Question Generation for Reading Comprehension](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.00106).

The model is built with the [OpenNMT](http://opennmt.net) framework.
