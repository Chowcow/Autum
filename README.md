# Generation Q
A tool for teachers to generate quiz questions for their daily reading assignments. Try it out here: www.generationq.online

The core question generation model is a Python implementation of the paper [Learning to Ask: Neural Question Generation for Reading Comprehension] (https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.00106)

The implementation is adapted from [OpenNMT](http://opennmt.net)
